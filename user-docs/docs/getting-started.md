# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through the basics of connecting to the HAI Protocol and taking your first steps as a user.

---

## 1. Connect Your Wallet

HAI runs on Optimism. You'll need an Ethereum wallet that supports the Optimism network.

Popular options include:

- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
- [Rabby](https://rabby.io/)
- [WalletConnect-compatible wallets](https://walletconnect.com/)

**Steps:**
1. Install your chosen wallet.
2. Add the **Optimism** network (chain ID `10`) if it is not already there.
3. Fund your wallet with ETH for gas fees.

---

## 2. Choose Your Collateral

Before you can mint HAI, you need to deposit an approved collateral asset.

Commonly accepted collaterals include:

- **haiVELO** – Yield-bearing token backed by veVELO
- **alETH** – Synthetic ETH from Alchemix
- **Yearn LP vault tokens** – Autocompounding LP positions

See [Collateral Types](./collateral-types) for the full list and parameters.

## 3. Mint HAI

Once you have chosen collateral:

1. Navigate to the HAI app.
2. Deposit your collateral.
3. Select how much HAI to mint (keep your vault health above the minimum collateral ratio to avoid liquidation).
4. Confirm the transaction in your wallet.

For details, see [How to Mint HAI](./minting-hai).

---

## 4. Put Your HAI to Work

After minting, you can:

- Provide HAI liquidity on supported DEXes to earn fees and incentives.
- Stake KITE to boost your native rewards.
- Contribute to the [Stability Pool](./stability-pool) for liquidation yield.

---

## 5. Monitor Your Position

Regularly check:

- Vault health / collateral ratio
- Rewards earned
- Protocol updates

If your collateral ratio falls below the required threshold, your vault may be liquidated.
