# Stability Pool

The Stability Pool is a new feature introduced in **HAI v2**, replacing the v1 liquidation system as the primary defense mechanism for maintaining HAI’s peg.

---

## From HAI v1 to HAI v2

- **In HAI v1**  
  When a vault’s collateral ratio dropped below the minimum, its collateral was sent to a **public auction**.  
  Any HAI holder could bid to purchase that collateral at a discount, with the winning bids paying back the vault’s debt.

- **In HAI v2**  
  Liquidations are handled **automatically** by the Stability Pool.  
  Instead of waiting for an auction, HAI from the Stability Pool instantly covers the debt, and the liquidated collateral is distributed to Stability Pool depositors.

  Public auctions still exist, but only as a **fallback** if the Stability Pool doesn’t have enough HAI to cover the liquidation.

## HAI V2 Enhancements & Value Additions

### 1. sHAI - Your Stability-Backed HAI
Receive *sHAI*, a yield-bearing token, when you deposit HAI into the Stability Pool.

As an sHAI holder, you can:
- Earn **stability fees**
- Collect **liquidation profits**
- Accumulate **KITE emissions**
- Maintain exposure to redemption rate (RR) directionality  
- And your sHAI remains usable across DeFi ecosystems.

### 2. Automated Liquidation Profit Sharing (ALPS)
This real-time system simplifies liquidation exposure and rewards:

- Liquidated collateral is auctioned at fixed discounts.
- Protocol automatically buys this collateral with Stability Pool HAI.
- Gains are auto-sold back into the pool, rewarding depositors instantly in HAI.
- Public auctions only open if the pool lacks enough HAI.

### 3. Sustainable, Aligned Incentives
- **KITE emissions** reward sHAI holders.
- Your position grows in yield and potential governance alignmen since sHAI is more than a pass-through token
- These layers ensure Stability Pool participants are central to HAI’s durability and growth.
