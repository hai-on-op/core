# KITE Staking

KITE staking is the mechanism that rewards long-term supporters of the HAI Protocol while helping them maximize their returns from haiVELO deposits and HAI minting incentives.

When you stake KITE, you receive **boosts** on rewards for certain collateral types and earn a share of protocol fees â€” all paid in the HAI stablecoin.

## Benefits of Staking KITE

By staking KITE, you:

- **Boost haiVELO deposit rewards**  
  Your share of HAI rewards from haiVELO deposits increases proportionally to your KITE stake.

- **Boost minting incentives**  
  When you mint HAI against approved collateral types (as decided by the DAO), your KITE stake increases the KITE emission rewards you earn.

- **Earn protocol fees**  
  Staked KITE holders receive a share of the protocolâ€™s fees, paid in HAI stablecoins.

- **No governance requirement**  
  KITE staking does not give voting power â€” itâ€™s purely a rewards and fee-sharing mechanism.

## How the Boost Works

Both **haiVELO deposit rewards** and **minting rewards** use the same boost logic.

- Without any KITE staked, you earn **base rewards**.
- Staking more KITE increases your **boost multiplier** (up to a maximum cap).
- The multiplier is calculated using a formula that considers:
  - The amount of KITE you have staked
  - The size of your deposit or minted position
  - The maximum boost parameters set by the DAO

> ðŸ“Œ *Exact boost parameters can be changed by governance over time. Always check the [KITE staking dashboard](https://www.letsgethai.com/stake) for the current boost numbers.*

## Example Scenarios

- **You deposit haiVELO without KITE staked:**  
  You receive the base HAI rewards rate.

- **You deposit haiVELO with KITE staked:**  
  Your HAI rewards rate is boosted according to your staked amount.

- **You mint HAI against approved collateral with KITE staked:**  
  Your KITE emission rewards are boosted, increasing your total yield.

## How to Stake

1. Go to the [KITE Staking page](https://www.letsgethai.com/stake).
2. Connect your wallet.
3. Enter the amount of KITE to stake.
4. Confirm the transaction.

You can unstake your KITE at any time, but doing so will reduce your boost multiplier.

## Key Takeaways

- Staking KITE **increases** your rewards for haiVELO deposits and certain HAI minting activities.
- You also earn a share of **protocol fees** in HAI stablecoins.
- Staking is **non-governance** â€” your KITE remains focused on yield boosting and fee sharing.
- The more KITE you stake (up to the cap), the greater your boost.
